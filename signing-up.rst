Signing up
======================

When you or your organization becomes a Survos client, you'll get a dedicated website, located at <clientCode>.survos.com.  You'll manage your users and participants, and have full control of this site.  Students who just want to use this system to run a survye with volunteers or other studets should see our student version.  You can also use this version for testing the system at a very low cost. 

Creating A Site for Your Organization
-------------------------------------

Once you've determined that you want to use the Posse Platform for managing a study, you'll create an account by going to <url>.  Click on the Create New Account button, and you'll see the following screen.

   Survos Create Account

Follow the prompts on the screen.  The only item that can't be changed later is the client code, which will also become part of your url, *clientCode*.survos.com.  

After a few minutes, you'll receive an email with your account login information.
