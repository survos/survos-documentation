Geo-data
================

Survos integrates with CartoDB to manage geo-data, features with location information.  A list of stores, with latitude and longitude, is a common example of geo-data.  The data can be *visualized* into a map.

Under to Geo tab in the dashboard, there are two items:

Managing Geo-Data
----------------------

The raw data is treated like a spreadsheet, a set of rows and columns, where at least one column has a *geometry* type.  A geometry type can be a point, e.g. the rooftop location of a store, or a polygon, like the outline of a store's footprint.

Maps
----------------------
Geographic data can be *visualized* on a map.  You can define symbol sets, display criteria, colors, and much more on the CartoDb site.  Maps are integrated into Survos as an option on top of tracks, or when viewing a mobile survey that has a "geographic feature" question.  . 

Survey questions with a "geographic feature" have a map button, when opens a map page showing the raw data.  (Check into offline cartodb maps).  Features are selected, and the popup infobox as a "use this" link, which fills in the appropriate data.
