Survos Personal Posse Platform
  Personal Posse is really a testbed.  It is more oriented to the *process* of data collection and study design rather than the actual data collection.  As such, it's perfect for students taking a class or for researchers who want to test the system before committing to a dedicated site.  

The key differences are listed in the table below.

|===========|============|
|Research   | Personal   |
|===========|============|

Enrollment:
  Research: Admins can enroll
  Personal: Self-enrollment only, users can invite people, but can't enroll them directly, or create accounts for them.
Compensation:
  Research: Pay participants via Paypal or AMT
  Personal: Participants volunteer, no $ 
Costs:
  Research: Higher costs, Paypal or check
  Personal: Reduced rates, paid via Paypal
Limits:
  Research: No limits
  Personal: 25 partipants / study, 3 active studies
Recruitment:
  Research: Integrated system for Turkers
  Personal: 


 
 * Account holders do need to pay for costs, including participant compensation.
 * Participants can withdraw their funds to Paypal or via AMT
 * As with academic, the primary purpose is to learn about surveys, not do survey research.  


Academic Version: The academic version of the Posse Platform uses the same tools as the research version, but manages accounts differently.  These are the key differences:

 * *Users*: Users are made up of other students and faculty, people who share the same email domain.  Survey participants are invited or self-enroll, they are not enrolled by administrators, as is done with the research version.
 * *Costs*: Costs, like SMS Costs, are paid by the university in a lump sum.  Credits are distributed to student accounts, who can use their balance to pay for SMS fees and participant compensation.
 * *Participant Compensation*: Participants, who are other students, are paid in credits which have no monetary value, except to be used within the system for other research projects.  So a participant who gets paid 200 credits to do a study can use those credits for their own study, or simply accummulate them for the game aspect.
 * *Faculty*: Instructors have the ability to fund student accounts, or use their credits for their own research.   
 * *Login*: If the university supports oAuth or some other single-login system, this can be integrated.  
 * *Privacy*: There is no anonymity.  The primary purpose is for students, not for bona fide research.
 
What about academics who want to do research?  

They should use the research version, either hosted or Saas.
